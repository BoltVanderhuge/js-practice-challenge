# JS Mini Challenge: Event Handling


## Setup

- Fork this repo, then run `git clone` to download your fork locally. Then `cd` into the downloaded directory and open it in your text editor with `code .`.
- Run `json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json` to get the backend started
- Open the `index.html` file on your browser

## Endpoints

Your base URL for your API will be: http://localhost:3000

The endpoints you will need are:

- GET `/travelers/1`
- PATCH `/travelers/1`
- GET `/animalSightings`
- POST `/animalSightings`
- PATCH `/animalSightings/:id`
- DELETE `/animalSightings/:id`


## Assignment

In this challenge, we're going to work on Raffy's Amazon trip page and give our users the ability to:

- See information about a traveler including their name, nickname, and number of likes when the page loads
- See all their animal sightings when the page loads
- Add a new animal sighting (no persistance needed)
- Click on the heart button to increase the number of likes for the traveler profile and still see the updated likes when I reload the page
- Toggle the header color between black and green


## Advanced Deliverables
- Persist the new animal sightings
  - Your animal sighting object must have a `travelerId` key with a value of `1` for it to work
- Add a like button to each sighting and implement a like feature that persists
- Add a delete button to each sighting and implement a delete feature that persists
