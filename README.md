## Setup

The endpoints you will need are:

## Assignment

In this challenge, we're going to work on Raffy's Amazon trip page and give our users the ability to:

- See information about a traveler including their name, nickname, and number of likes when the page loads
- See all their animal sightings when the page loads
- Add a new animal sighting (no persistance needed)
- Click on the heart button to increase the number of likes for the traveler profile and still see the updated likes when I reload the page
- Toggle the header color between black and green
