## Setup

- Fork and clone this repository if you haven't already
- Run `json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json` to get the backend started

## Assignment

In this challenge, we're going to work on Raffy's Amazon trip page and give our users the ability to:

- See information about a traveler including their name, nickname, and number of likes when the page loads
- See all their animal sightings when the page loads
- Add a new animal sighting (no persistance needed)
- Click on the heart button to increase the number of likes for the traveler profile and still see the updated likes when I reload the page
- Toggle the header color between black and green


There's a section in this Readme file for your notes on each deliverable. As you go through the deliverables, write down some notes in this file on how you solved each problem. It'll help reinforce what you learned and give you a head start next time you see a similar problem.
